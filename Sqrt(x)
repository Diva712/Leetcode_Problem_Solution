Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = x;
        int ans = 0;
        while(low<=high){
            int mid = low+(high-low)/2;
           // int sq = mid*mid;
            if(mid == x/mid){
                return mid;
            }
            else if(mid > x/mid){
                high = mid-1;
            }
            else{
                low = mid+1;
                ans = mid;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
